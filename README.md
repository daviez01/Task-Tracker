# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to my first React project! This project was created as a way for me to learn the basics of React and familiarize myself with the React framework.

* CSS

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

* index.js: The main entry point for the application.
* App.js: The main component for the application.
* Header.js: A child component that displays the header of the app and also   contains the button component.
